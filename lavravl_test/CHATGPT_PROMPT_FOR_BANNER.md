# ChatGPT Prompt for Perfect Banner Image 🎨

## Copy and Paste This Exact Prompt:

```
Create a horizontal website banner image with these EXACT specifications:

DIMENSIONS: 1920 pixels WIDE × 400 pixels TALL
(Width must be MUCH larger than height - wide horizontal/landscape format)

CONTENT:
- Friendly dog with basket (make the dog SMALLER, not too prominent)
- Himalayan Basket Bars products visible
- Mountains in background (Himalayan theme)
- Text: "LONG-LASTING DOG CHEWS" (if you want text in image)
- Product bars visible

STYLE:
- Warm, earthy colors (browns, tans, golds)
- Illustrative, natural, rustic
- Professional e-commerce banner style

IMPORTANT REQUIREMENTS:
1. Image MUST be 1920px wide × 400px tall (WIDE, not tall)
2. Dog should be SMALLER, not dominating the image
3. More WIDTH emphasis - spread content across the width
4. Landscape/horizontal orientation (like a wide movie screen)
5. PNG format, high quality

Make it suitable for a website banner slider that is 400px tall and full width.

## Why These Dimensions?

- **Banner Height:** 400px (fixed)
- **Banner Width:** Full screen width (typically 1920px on desktop)
- **Aspect Ratio:** 4.8:1 (wide horizontal)
- **Your current images:** 1536×1024 (portrait - wrong orientation)

## What's Wrong with Current Images?

❌ **1536 × 1024** = Portrait (taller than wide)
✅ **1920 × 400** = Landscape (wider than tall) ← THIS IS WHAT YOU NEED

## After Creating:

1. Save as: `banner-wide.png`
2. Place in: `public/images/`
3. It will fit perfectly! ✅
