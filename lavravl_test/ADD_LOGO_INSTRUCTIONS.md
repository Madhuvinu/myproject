# How to Add Your Logo Image

## Steps to Add the Yeti/Bigfoot Logo:

1. **Save your logo image** (the one with the Yeti/Bigfoot holding a basket)

2. **Name it one of these:**
   - `logo.png` (recommended)
   - `logo.jpg`
   - `logo.jpeg`
   - `logo.svg`

3. **Copy the image file to this location:**
   ```
   /Users/harshakm/myproject/lavravl_test/public/images/logo.png
   ```

4. **If the images folder doesn't exist, create it:**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p /Users/harshakm/myproject/lavravl_test/public/images
   ```

5. **Refresh your browser** - the logo should appear!

## Quick Command (if you have the image file):

If your logo image is saved somewhere on your computer, you can copy it using:

```bash
# Replace /path/to/your/logo.png with the actual path to your image
cp /path/to/your/logo.png /Users/harshakm/myproject/lavravl_test/public/images/logo.png
```

## Image Requirements:

- **Format:** PNG, JPG, JPEG, or SVG
- **Size:** Any size (will be automatically resized to fit)
- **Background:** Transparent or white works best
- **Recommended:** 200x200 pixels or larger for best quality

The logo will automatically fit inside the circular border and scale properly!
